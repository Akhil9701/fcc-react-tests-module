To run this project locally clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run `npm start`. Now you can view all the finished challenges live in the browser.

We're conducting tests on React components using [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) which look like this:

```javascript
assert.strictEqual(shallowRender.type(), 'div', 'The component renders a div element');
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
