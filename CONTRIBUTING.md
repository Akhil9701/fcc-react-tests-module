##Instructions for QA:##

**We are currently trying to review these challenges to prepare them for addition to the Free Code Camp curriculum expansion. We need your help!** [View the challenges here and begin working through them](http://hysterical-amusement.surge.sh/)

We need campers to provide feedback specifically in these areas:

- The content of each challenge explains the topic well
- There are no grammatical errors in the content
- The tests are clear and function properly
- Each individual challenge functions correctly without any bugs :sweat_smile:

In addition, we tried to create a nice flow to the overall narrative of the challenges. If you work through several in sequence, try to reflect on how well the challenges perform consequetively.

##To Submit Your Feedback:##

The easiest way to submit feedback on a challenge is to open an Issue here on the repository. Title it with the name of the challenge if an Issue has not already been opened for that challenge. Then provide your feedback in the Issue and we'll open a discussion to deal with it. There is already an [Issue specifically for providing general feedback](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module/issues/17).

Alternatively, you can fork and edit the repository directly and submit a pull request if you are comfortable doing that. However, it will be best to at least open a discussion about the changes unless you find something that unambiguously needs to be changed.
